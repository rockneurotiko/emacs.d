;;; Commentary:

;; This script provides functionality for automatically updating your Emacs
;; packages periodically. It is specially usefull for people that work in
;; multiple machines and tend to forget to manually update packages from time to
;; time. The periodicity of the update is given by the custom variable
;; `auto-package-update-interval'.
;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 0.1 - First release

;;; Code:
